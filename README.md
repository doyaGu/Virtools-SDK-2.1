Reconstructed Virtools SDK 2.1.0.14

# Introduction

This SDK is created based on the Virtools SDK 2.5.0.48 and the reverse engineering of the Virtools 2.1.0.14 dynamic libraries. 

This SDK is intended for developers who are interested in creating new native building blocks, managers, and plugins for the game made in Virtools 2.1.0.14 such as Ballance. 

This SDK is working in progress. Please be aware that some functions or class declarations may be not compatible with the original version. If you encounter an incompatible bug caused by the SDK, please report an issue.
